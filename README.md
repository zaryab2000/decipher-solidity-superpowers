# decipher-solidity-superpowers

a dedicated Claude Code plugin providing gate-enforced workflow for Solidity smart contract development. It enforces a strict phase sequence: **Plan → Build → Test → Gas Optimize → NatSpec → Deploy/Upgrade → Audit Prep** — where each phase is a mandatory gate, not an optional suggestion.
